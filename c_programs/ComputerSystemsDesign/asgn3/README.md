In order to run my code you must use this command
./httpserver -c -l localhost 8080

* The port number is optional(it will default to localhost)
* The flags -c and -l can also be inputted as -l -c

Known issues:
  My program does not have logging(did not get it to work on time)
  However, the cache flag still works.
