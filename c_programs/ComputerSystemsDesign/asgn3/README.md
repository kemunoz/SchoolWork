In order to run my code you must use this command
./httpserver -c -l localhost 8080

*The port number is optional
* the flags -c and -l can also be inputted as -l -c
*dpesnt necessarily have to be localhost it was just an example
Known issues:
My program does not have logging(did not get it to work on time)
However the cache flag will turn the caching on and off.
