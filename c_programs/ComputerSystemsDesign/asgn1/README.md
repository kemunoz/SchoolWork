Runnning my code:
1. Use "make" command to compile the executable binary file
2. use "make clean" to get rid of any extra files
3. Use "./httpserver <IP/Hostname> <Port Number>" 
	-if no portnumber is given then it is defaulted to 8080

Issues:

There are currently no known issues with the code However I did not test using netcast.\
Therefore there might be some issues with using the netcast command.
