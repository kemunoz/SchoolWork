Runnning my code:
1. Use make command to get executable binary
2. use make clean to get rid of any extra files
3. Use "./httpserver <IP/Hostname> <Port NUmber>" 
	-if no portnumber is given then it is set to 8080 default

Issues:

There are currently no known issues with the code However id di not test using netcast.\
Therefore there might be some issues with using the netcast command because I thought our code
would only be tested using curl
